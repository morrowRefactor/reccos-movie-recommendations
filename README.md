Summary:
The flow of the app is very straight-forward.  A user searches for a movie they'd like to use as a baseline for finding recommendations.  After they run a search, they'll select the movie they want to rate (this step is necessary as a general search will return multiple possibilities).  Finally the user applies their rating and searches for similar recommendations.
Future iterations will allow for storing selected movies and enhanced search functionality.

Tools used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript/jQuery, TMDb API
